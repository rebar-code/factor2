# Analysis & Preparation for Factor2 Scoping Call

Hi Amanda,

We are thrilled to be moving forward and are already mapping out the project. To ensure our first official scoping session is highly productive, we've prepared the following questions.

Your answers will help us understand your day-to-day operations, confirm technical requirements, and allow us to align the project plan with your business goals. Please review these with your team and jot down any initial thoughts. We will walk through them in detail during our call.

## Discovery Questions for Factor2

### 1. Business Goals & Success Metrics

_The goal here is to understand the "why" behind the project._

- Beyond the technical requirements, what are the top 3 business goals you hope to achieve with the new website? (e.g., increase online sales by 20%, reduce time spent on order processing, improve customer satisfaction)
- How will you measure the success of this project one year after launch?
- What are the biggest frustrations with your current Volusion site that you are most excited to solve?

### 2. Design, Branding & User Experience

_This helps us align the visual direction and user flow._

- We created a basic demo to show Shopify's feasibility. What aspects of your current site's design and layout do you feel work well and should be kept? What would you like to change or modernize?
- What features or functionalities do you think your customers appreicat the most
- The proposal includes customer accounts. Besides viewing order history, what other features would be valuable for a logged-in customer?

### 3. Product & Data Migration

_Understanding your product structure is critical._

- Could you provide a sample export of your products from Volusion?
- How are your products structured? Do you use variants (like size), and do you have products that are bundles of other products?
- Besides products, what other data is essential to migrate? Is migrating past order history a firm requirement?
- How do you currently search for past orders?

### 4. Shipping & Hazardous Materials Compliance

_This is a crucial and complex part of your business._

- Please walk us through your current, step-by-step process for fulfilling and shipping an order containing a flammable product.
- Do you ship hazardous via both UPS and FedEx?
- Are there specific shipping rules for different products or destinations? (e.g., no air freight, restrictions on shipping to certain states/countries)

### 5. Accounting: QuickBooks Online Integration

_Your move to QBO is great news and simplifies things._

- What is your target date for completing the migration to QuickBooks Online?
- Can you describe your ideal workflow for how an online order should be processed in your accounting system? For example:
  - What specific data needs to sync between Shopify and QBO (orders, inventory, customers, taxes, etc.)?
  - At what point should an invoice be created in QBO?
  - When should that invoice be marked as paid?
- Who is the main point of contact on your team for the QBO migration?

### 6. Legal: Custom Affidavit & Signature

_This custom feature needs a clearly defined workflow._

- Who needs to sign the affidavit? (e.g., all new customers, only customers buying specific products)
- When do they need to sign it? (e.g., before their first purchase, once per year, every time they buy a hazardous item)
- What is the process? Does a successful signature "unlock" their ability to check out? What happens if they don't sign?
- Where does the signed document need to be stored, and for how long?

---

### 7. Payments, Translations, and Marketing

_These questions cover the remaining scope items._

- **Payments:** The proposal included Authorize.net and ACH. What payment methods are essential for launch? Are you wanting to stay with Authorize.net or move to Shopify for payments?
<!-- - **Translations:** What languages and countries are your initial priority for the multi-lingual features? Do you have translated content ready, or will you need a process for that? -->
- **SEO & Marketing:** To preserve your search engine ranking, we will need to create redirects from your old URLs. Are you aware of any current marketing activities (e.g., email campaigns, ad links) that rely on specific links to your site?
