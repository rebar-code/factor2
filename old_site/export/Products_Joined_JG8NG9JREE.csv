benefit of being dimensionally stable with very low to no shrinkage. Since it
is a gum rubber you can actually sculpt your piece directly into the silicone

also has a long 6 hour working time in an optimal 65F work space. HCR

properties than our other Silicone Elastomers. HCR Silicones also have the
benefit of being dimensionally stable with very low to no shrinkage. Since it
is a gum rubber you can actually sculpt your piece directly into the silicone
itself. HCR's also bond well to most substrates making it a great laminate, it
also has a long 6 hour working time in an optimal 65F work space. HCR
silicones must be heated to reach full cure.</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Franklin Gothic Book&quot;, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);""><br style=""box-sizing: border-box;"" />
